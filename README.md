The "Banking System" project is a Java-based application designed for 
banking operations with a graphical user interface (GUI). It employs 
Java Swing for the UI components and follows essential ObjectOriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system provides 
functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing funds, 
withdrawing funds, and viewing transaction histories. This paragraph
